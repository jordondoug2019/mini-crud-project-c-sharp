In groups of 2 create a simple site for tracking a video game collection.

A game entry in your collection should include properties for game name, game genre, datae released, and synopsis (what the game is about)..

Create corresponding HTML pages for the frontend to support your CRUD operations. You can use seperate individual pages or a single page where you show/hide the forms for CRUD operations.

The landing page should list the current games in your collection.
